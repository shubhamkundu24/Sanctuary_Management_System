Hello Sirjit & Shubham

Website 1 :- Sanctuary Management System




Your task is to create a user-friendly and informative website for an animal 
sanctuary that caters to both the needs of the sanctuary staff and 
potential visitors. The sanctuary aims to provide a platform where users 
can engage with the organization, learn about the animals under their 
care, and contribute to their cause.
Core Features:
1. User Registration/Login: Implement a simple login/signup system 
for validation (UI Only).
2. Animal Profiles Page: Create basic animal profiles displaying 
essential information such as name, species, age, and a brief 
description of each animal.
3. Medical Records: Include a section where sanctuary staff can 
manage basic medical records for each animal. This could be as 
simple as a table with columns for date, treatment, and notes.
4. Contact Form Page: Create a contact form allowing users to send 
messages or inquiries to sanctuary staff and display a message 
upon submission.
5. Tutorials Section Page: Include a beginner-friendly tutorial section 
with tips on pet care, wildlife conservation, or how to get involved 
with the sanctuary. Keep the content concise and easy to 
understand for newcomers.
6. Social Media Links: Include icons linking to the sanctuary's social 
media profiles (e.g., Facebook, Instagram). 
Brownie Points:
1. Adoption System: Enhance the animal profiles to include an 
adoption status. Add a button or form for users to express interest in 
adopting an animal. When an animal is adopted, update its profile to 
reflect its adoption status.
2. Responsive Design: Ensure the website layout adjusts to different 
screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly. 
3. Gallery Page: Create a dedicated page within the website where 
users can access the image gallery. This page should have a layout 
that displays multiple images in a visually appealing manner.
4. Feedback Form: Create a feedback form where users can provide 
suggestions or report issues with the website. Use a basic form 
submission method to collect feedback and display a thank-you 
message upon submission.
